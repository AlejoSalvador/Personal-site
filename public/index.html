          <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME </span>
          <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Buenos Aires. I was working on a startup but since it did not work out I am back
to finishing my thesis. My areas of expertise are computer graphics, discrete mathematics, algorithms, data structures and systems
programming. My main programming languages are C++ and Javascript. During high school, I competed in several national and
international Olympiads in Mathematics, Informatics and Physics.</p>
